\opening{Dear Sir/Madam,}

I am writing to you to apply for several internships at D.E. Shaw \& Co. I hope that I find you in good health, my name is David Lawton and I am a university student at Trinity College Dublin. I am currently enrolled in a BA in Theoretical Physics.\\

I believe I would be well suited for any of the internships for which I am applying, foremost of which I would put the Quantitative Analyst Intern position. I am not someone who has ever had much exposure to financial markets, and I want to change that. I am curious about the processes that sustain investment firms, especially the mathematics and coding behind the decisions that are made everyday in such corporations.\\

The skills I possess that I believe are most relevant to these internships are the maths/physics/programming tools I have gained during college, the problem solving skills that I have always tried to nurture and challenge, and my commitment to learning. I think that my ability to adapt to a new environment, which I improved when I moved to a new city for college, my experience in hospitality, and my involvement in team sports, would allow me to collaborate well with my co-workers. I would also mention my ability to write in Latex, and my familiarity with analysing data in experimental physics laboratories.\\

Please find attached my CV, Academic History, and writing sample. Thank you for your considerations, I await your response patiently.\\


\closing{Yours faithfully,}
