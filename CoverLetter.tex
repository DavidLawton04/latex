\opening{Dear Sir/Madam,}
I am writing to you today to apply for a job as a general assistant at Musgrave Wholesale Partners. I am a student at Trinity College Dublin, studying Theoretical Physics, and I am looking for a job to help support myself during my studies. I have experience working in the hospitality industry, having worked as a kitchen porter at Maryborough Hotel and Spa, and as a food and beverage assistant at Fota Island Resort. I believe that my experience in the hospitality industry has given me the skills necessary to work in a fast-paced, customer-based environment, and to work as part of a collaborative effort. I am a hard-working and reliable individual, and I am confident that I would be an asset to your team. I am available to work evenings and weekends, and I am available to start immediately. I look forward to hearing from you.\\
\closing{Yours sincerely,}

\end{letter}
